## ✅ Tasks Performed

---

## 🧮 Task 1: Basic Excel Formulas
The following formulas were applied to analyze sales data:
- `SUM()` – Calculate Total Sales  
- `AVERAGE()` – Calculate Average Sales  
- `MAX()` and `MIN()` – Identify highest and lowest sales  
- `COUNT()` – Count numeric sales records  
- `COUNTA()` – Count non-empty records  

📌 **Outcome:** Generated summary metrics for sales performance.

---

## 🔍 Task 2: Logical Functions
Logical conditions were implemented using:
- `IF()` to classify sales as **High Sales** or **Low Sales**
- `AND()` to evaluate **Good Performance** based on Sales and Profit conditions  

📌 **Outcome:** Added business logic for performance evaluation.

---

## 🧹 Task 3: Data Cleaning
Data quality was improved using:
- `TRIM()` and `PROPER()` for text cleaning  
- Removing duplicate records  
- Text to Columns to split Customer Email  
- Find & Replace to fix inconsistencies  

📌 **Outcome:** Clean, standardized, and analysis-ready dataset.

---

## 🔗 Task 4: Lookup & Date Functions
Advanced functions were used:
- `XLOOKUP()` to fetch Category using Product ID  
- `YEAR()` and `TEXT()` to extract Year and Month from Order Date  

📌 **Outcome:** Enabled relational lookups and time-based analysis.

---

## 📊 Task 5: Pivot Tables & Charts
The following Pivot Tables and Charts were created:
- **Total Sales by Region** (Column Chart)  
- **Profit by Category (% of Total)**  
- **Monthly Sales Trend** (Line Chart)  

📌 **Outcome:** High-level insights into sales distribution and trends.

---

## 📈 Task 6: Interactive Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was designed featuring:
- KPI Cards (Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Sales)  
- Pivot Charts for Sales, Profit, and Trends  
- Slicers for **Region** and **Category**  
- Dynamic KPI updates using Pivot Table linkage  

📌 **Outcome:** Professional, interactive Excel dashboard.

## 🧠 Task 7: Conceptual Questions (Key Learnings)

### Why Excel is Widely Used
- Easy to use and widely available  
- Supports data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- Ideal for quick insights and dashboards  

### COUNT vs COUNTA
- COUNT → counts numeric values only  
- COUNTA → counts all non-empty cells  

### Importance of Pivot Tables
- Summarize large datasets quickly  
- Identify patterns and trends  
- Enable interactive reporting  

### Role of Slicers
- Visual filters for pivot tables  
- Improve dashboard interactivity  
- Enable quick comparative analysis  

### Importance of Data Cleaning
- Ensures accuracy and reliability  
- Removes duplicates and inconsistencies  
- Prevents incorrect analysis and decisions
